# react-native-easy-navigation
Simple and fast navigation for react-native

> Note: Needs `react-native-reanimated` and `react-native-gesture-handler`!

## Why use this instead of react-navigation or wix?

Well, in most cases I guess the best option this to choose one above but I created this lib so I could create apps faster with less worry about the navigation part.

## What does this package do?

- Supports left-to-right transitions for ios and android
- Same transitions on both ios and android
- Drawer support
- Tabs support
- Supports push, replace and pop screens
- Regular screens
- Half panels
- Modals
- Layover
